A DEV token is a crypto asset created to support OSS.

The Dev Protocol, which uses blockchain technology staking, was born as a mechanism to provide continuous support to all creators. The DEV token is a crypto asset issued by the Dev Protocol.
Staking is like depositing money in a bank. Just as deposits earn interest, depositing DEV tokens (deposits) with OSS (banks) earns interest.
By separating this interest from the developer, the interest (reward) to the developer becomes a donation to the developer.

## What is the mechanism for continuous support?

The staking DEV token is in a deposited state. Since it is deposited, it will not be reduced or lost, and you can withdraw it whenever you want. In addition, interest will be paid to both the supporter and the developer during the deposit. In other words, it is better to deposit the purchased DEV token than to have it.
Interest will stop if you withdraw the DEV token. For supporters, it is better to leave it without withdrawing it. Interest also goes into the developer, which is a donation to the developer. The Dev Protocol uses this mechanism to provide continuous support to developers.

## How much interest will you earn

Interest will be given to supporters at an annual rate of around 30% (as of June 12, 2021) †1 Creators will also be donated at an annual rate of around 30% (as of June 12, 2021) †2
You can see that the interest rate is high compared to the interest rate of the bank.

## How to stake

To stake, you first need to find the project you want to support at Stakes.social. Find the project you want to support from the project list page.
To find the project you want to help, it's a good idea to search for the name of your favorite OSS by keyword, or find out what the OSS is from the OSS details page (the details page has a link to Github, so README). It is also recommended to read the file to see it)

When you find the project you want to help, press the "Stake" button, which will display the modal. The modal has an input form for entering the staking amount, so enter the number of DEVs you want to stake. After completing the input, check again and press the "Stake" button.
When you press the "Stake" button, your wallet will be launched and the transaction and the gas cost required to process the transaction will be confirmed.

On the Ethereum platform, a transaction fee (gas fee) is required to process the transaction. Dev Protocol also requires this fee because it works on the Ethereum platform. Let's prepare in advance.

When the transaction is processed and the staking is complete, the message “success staking!” Is displayed.

Now you deposited your DEV token in the OSS you want to support.
DEV tokens with an annual interest rate of around 30% (as of June 12, 2021)†1 and developers with an annual rate of around 30% (as of June 12, 2021)†2 will be donated.

The more you continue to stake, the more benefits you will receive and the more ongoing donations you will make to the developers you helped, and the more developers you support will be able to focus more on development. For that reason, we recommend that you continue staking for as long as possible.
