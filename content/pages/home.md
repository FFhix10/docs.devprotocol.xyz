## What is Dev Protocol?

Dev protocol is a open source middleware that brings fairly economic value to Open source software(OSS).　
Anyone can start without changing licenses, codes and support. Just tokenize your OSS in a minute with [Stakes.social](/stakes-social/index.html).


### What is currently broken in the OSS world?

Currently in the open-source software development scene, sustainability has been a longstanding problem for developers looking to participate. Despite many OSS projects having a massive user base, they still rely on philanthropic donations in order to operate. Generous patrons are essential to the long term survival of OSS projects, but they are usually not rewarded for their patronage, at least not monetarily.
The Dev Protocol offers a solution to both problems, making the relationship between patrons and developers mutually beneficial and bringing sustainability to OSS.

### Dev Protocol as middleware

Dev Protocol is not a single platform, it's middleware. Dev Protocol is completely decentralized and is a middleware protocol for on-chain governance, anyone can join the ecosystem by developing various applications (Dapps). It allows anyone to develop decentralised applications(Dapps) with incentives for staking and extend their authorisable assets through the market. The Dev Protocol is not closed to OSS, but can bring value to all open assets such as researchers' papers, Youtube videos, and Spotify music. Dev Protocol integrates with these markets so that projects or creators can authenticate and tokenize their work.
It is a whole new creator economy evolving from open creators assets. 🪐

### Dev Protocol by numbers

Under the mission of "creating a society where all innovators are valued and can achieve sustainably", Dev Protocol started MVP in 2018 and began a service for OSS developers to monetize. After the release of "Stakes.social", our first Dapp, in June 2020, our sustainable incentive scheme that utilizes a blockchain, attracted attention from overseas, and its ecosystem continues to grow dramatically. In the last one year, the total number of staking reached around 6 million USD, and the cumulative total amount of reward went up to approximately 2 million USD. (as of April 2021)

### The value of the Dev Protocol

The positive cycle created by OSS and open assets being sustainable and able to collaborate with more stakeholders is the greatest value of all. But the Dev Protocol is more than just a way for creators to monetize; it serves as the core for creators to easily expand and manage their own ecosystem. At the core of this are creator tokens and staking. The UI for these to work is only partially complete, but the community's goal is to fully build these creator ecosystem extensions so that they become the first choice of creators when they decide to create something.
A creator token divides the ownership of a project. There are various use cases where the owner can extend the project, such as for project governance or for incentivizing collaborators. It would also be easy to create a liquidity pool paired with DEV. Dev staking's split rewards would be distributed to creators based on their share of creator tokens so that creators could provide a built-in incentive model for creator token holders.
Notes: It should be mentioned that the staking ratio is higher than the annual inflation rate and that the DIP-55(https://github.com/dev-protocol/DIPs/blob/main/DIPS/dip-55.md) gives creators an incentive to re-stake their creator rewards.
