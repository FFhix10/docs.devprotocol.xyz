## What is Dev Protocol?

Dev Protocol is an inflationary middleware protocol that optimizes open asset monetization through crowdsourcing valuations. Protocol participants stake the DEV token on projects they believe are valuable. The protocol rewards these participants and the projects they staked for with minted DEV tokens. Examples of open assets are OSS projects, Youtube videos, and Spotify content. Dev Protocol integrates with these markets so that projects or creators can authenticate and tokenize their work.
