The following guide and hands-on will help you to integrate DEV to your web application. First is, we will follow the guide below before going to hands-on:

### MetaMask Installation Guide

This hands-on uses Metamask. If you do not have metamask in your browser add-on, please install metamask from the following URL for Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en

If you are using another browser, search for Metamask from the store and then add it. If you can't find Metamask, try using Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

### Creating a wallet address for the Ropsten environment

After installing Metamask, specify the Ropsten environment and create a wallet.

### Get ETH

Since gas fee is required for hands-on, please use the following site to obtain about 1 ETH.

- https://faucet.metamask.io/

### Get DEV token

Get the wallet address of DEV token by asking the Dev Protocol team on [discord server](https://discord.gg/VwJp4KM) as you will need a DEV token for hands-on

### Getting Started

This hands-on uses a playground called CodeSandbox. Playground is an online web development environment, and it is a web service that allows you to code without preparing a development environment on your computer.
